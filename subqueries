This SQL query calculates the average total payment made by the top 5 customers (based on payment amount) from the top 10 cities in the top 10 countries with the most customers.

1. Inner queries (SELECTs within subqueries): Identify the top 10 countries, then the top 10 cities in those countries based on customer count.
2. filteredCities: Filters customers from the top cities and countries, and calculates the total payment for each customer.
3. total_amount_paid: Selects the top 5 customers by total payment within those cities and countries.
4. Final SELECT: Computes the average total payment of the top 5 highest-paying customers.

The result is the average payment made by the top-paying customers in these cities and countries.
