This SQL query identifies and compares customer activity in the top 10 countries by customer count using a common table expression.

1. TopCountries: Finds the top 10 countries with the most customers.
2. FilteredCities: Filters cities within those top 10 countries, selecting the top 10 cities by customer count.
3. TopCustomers: Identifies the top 5 customers (by total payment) in those cities.
4. TotalCustomers: Counts all unique customers in each country.
5. Final SELECT: Compares the count of top-paying customers to the total customer count in each country.

The result shows the number of top customers and the total customers in each of the top countries.
